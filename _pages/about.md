Warm Greetings!!!

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am Jannatim Maisha, an Adjunct Lecturer at the Department of CSE, <a href="https://seu.edu.bd/index.php">Southeast University (SEU)</a>. I have completed B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh. My research interests are centered on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, Contrastive Learning, Speech Recognition, and the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning methodologies.
<br><br>
My previous research focused on addressing challenges in low-resource Natural Language Processing (NLP). I employed advanced methods such as contrastive learning and adversarial training to enhance classification performance, particularly in fine-grained tasks for languages like Bengali. Additionally, I have worked on computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and speech recognition, as well as involved in applying NLP and computer vision techniques to specific software engineering tasks. I embrace a creative approach to problem-solving. I take great joy in teaching what I learn. I am a dependable individual with excellent time management skills, always energetic and eager to acquire new knowledge, driven by natural curiosity.
