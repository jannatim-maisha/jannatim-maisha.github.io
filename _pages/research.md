## Under Review
* F. H. Swarnali, <a style="text-decoration: none">J. Maisha</a>, M. A. Mahtab, M. S. I. Iftikar, and F. M. Shah, “**Bengali multi-class text classification via enhanced contrastive learning techniques**,” in 2024 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><font  size="2">- Extending thesis work by introducing new loss functions, Token-level Adversarial Contrastive Training (TACT)
and Label-aware Contrastive Loss (LCL), to improve text classification in Bengali. Developed a
custom multi-class dataset for text classification. Applied contrastive learning techniques using a pre-trained
Bengali BERT model, achieving new benchmarks for binary and multi-class sentiment analysis.</font></span><br>
* M. A. Mahtab, <a style="text-decoration: none">J. Maisha,</a> M. M. Rahman, and S. K. S. Joy, “**An empirical study on utilizing large language models for bengali image caption generation**,” in 2024 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><font  size="2">- This study pioneers the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like BanglaGPT for Bengali image captioning, combining CLIP encodings and Vision Transformer-based architectures. The models significantly outperform existing benchmarks on the BanglaLekha and BNature datasets, achieving high BLEU and CIDEr scores, thus advancing the field of Bengali image captioning.</font></span><br>

## Conference Presentation
* **A Study of Contrastive Learning Methods for Bengali Social Analysis**, 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information & Communication Technology (ICEEICT), Dhaka, Bangladesh. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czj9QxdQjM">Presentation link</a>

## Ongoing Projects
* Contrastive Learning methods in code-mixed languages.
* Sub-Dialect Detection and Translation Using Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Training for Bangla.
* Plagiarism Detection in Bengali Cover Songs.
* Fake review dataset.
